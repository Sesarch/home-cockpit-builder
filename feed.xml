    Introduction Building a home cockpit doesn't have to be expensive. In this guide, we break down exactly what you need to simulate a Cessna 172 at home, from the desk to the throttle.<br><br>1. The Foundation: The Desk You can't put a heavy yoke on a glass table. You need a sturdy mounting system.<br><br>2. The Controls: Yoke vs. Stick For a Cessna, you need a Yoke. While sticks are great for fighter jets, a yoke gives you the true general aviation feel.<br><br>3. The Throttle: Why "Vernier" Matters Most gamers use standard levers, but real Cessnas use "Push-Pull" (Vernier) throttles. If you want realism, you need a proper TPM unit.<br><br>Conclusion Start small. Get the desk and the throttle right, and you are 90% there.
